    "### **Model Analysis**\n",
    "This model analysis explores heart disease among a population of males and females between 29 and 77 years of age using risk factors that determine its prevalence. The risk factors are indicators such as age, sex, chest pain (CP), resting blood pressure (trestbps), cholesterol levels (chol), fasting blood sugar (fbs), resting electrocardiogram (ecg), thalassemia (thalach), exercise induced angina (exang), ekg significant ST depression (oldpeak), the slope of the ST segment (slope), type of vessel defect (thal), and the number of major blood vessels shown on flouroscopy (ca). The values of the risk factors determine the value of the target indicator of the patient having a diagnosis of heart disease. The model will support hospital clinicians by predicting those who are at risk for heart disease. "

    "The analysis might fit into an application or investigation by comparing timely access to care, clinicians' disease diagnosis, and prevention treatment of those at risk for heart disease. The model would improve the quality of care by eliminating barriers to accessibility. In addition, physicians will be able to make more accurate diagnoses and predictions of heart disease. It also will assist providers in interpreting data and implementing a more predictive treatment in heart disease prevention."

Other limitations include not considering all non-modifiable risk factors that cannot be changed, such as ethnicity and family history."
