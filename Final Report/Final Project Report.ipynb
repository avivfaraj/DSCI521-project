    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The project focuses on heart disease prediction providing an analysis and model using the Cleveland dataset developed by [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). The dataset contains numeric (quantitative) and structured data of heart disease indicators in patients. The sample size contains 303 patients with 46% having remarkable heart disease indicators. The remaining 54% do not meet the indicators of heart disease and thus are considered healthy. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 14 parameters or indicators. The \"target\" prediction depicts whether a patient is healthy, indicated by value 0, or has heart disease indicated by value 1, 2, 3, or 4 (different stages of heart disease).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to understand risk factors by analyzing the dataset using exploratory data analysis. In addition, a model was developed based on the analysis that predicts heart disease condition among patients with 84% precision. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before reviewing the dataset, we will explain the characteristics of normal QRS and ST segments to provide our diverse audience an overview of the heart's electrical conduction system. Furthermore, to provide a better understanding of the data set and how the heart contracts to pump blood throughout the body's vascular system and to its organs.\n",

    "The results of an electrocardiogram (ECG) test tell us how well the heart is functioning by tracing the electrical activity within the heart. Normally, the electrical pulse moves from the sinoatrial node, represented by the P wave, across the atrium, to the atrioventricular node and through the ventricular septum of the heart represented by the QRS complex. The norm is that the Q wave is always negative (as you can see, the downslope from the isoelectric line (x axis)), and the R wave is the first positive wave of the complex (see how the slope moves up from the Q wave). The S wave is the first negative deflection after the R wave. The start of the ST segment is called the J point and is used to diagnose an ST-segment elevation.  Studying the elevation or depression of the j point from the baseline is significant in determining heart disease.\n",
    "The T wave will normally follow the direction of the QRS complex. When it occurs in the opposite direction, it reflects cardiac disease.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Attributes Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Age - Age of patient in years (Integer)\n",
    "1. Sex - Gender of patient (1 = male, 0 = female)\n",
    "1. cp - Chest pain type: Chest pain is referred to as angina and is associated with not having enough blood flow to the heart. Signs of angina are feeling pressure or a squeezing pain in the chest, shoulder, arms, neck, jaw, or back.\n",
    "    1. Value 1: Typical Angina - substernal chest pain precipitated by physical exertion or emotional stress and relieved with rest or nitroglycern (medication that cause venous dilation, promoting increase flow of oxygen).\n",
    "    1. Value 2: Atypical Angina - pain is actually in the chest under the breast bone.\n",
    "    1. Value 3: Non-Anginal Pain - last over 30 minutes or less than 5 seconds and increases with inspiration (inhaling). May be felt with movement and relieved when lying down.\n",
    "    1. Value 4: Asymptomatic Angina - evident electrocardiogram (ECG) changes showing ischemia with absence of angina (pain).\n",
    "1. trestbps - Resting blood pressure (in mm/Hg on admission to hospital)\n",
    "1. chol - Serum cholesterol desirable level is less than 200 mg/dl, borderline high is 200-239 mg/dl and high is equal to or above 240 mg/dl. High cholestrol leads to the development of fatty deposits in blood vessels which restricts blood flow through the arteries to the heart.\n",
    "1. fbs - Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl <br> (1 = true, 0 = false). This test is used to determine if diabetes is present.\n",
    "1. restecg - Resting electrocardiographic results: \n",
    "    1. Value 0: normal \n",
    "    1. Value 1: Having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV) ST-T wave abnormality shows a remarkable injury to the heart.\n",
    "    1. Value 2: Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria. Estes is a scoring ECG criteria that measures the voltage of the leads placed on the limbs during the ECG test. The criteria also compares the ST-T segment to the entire QRS segment and P wave (atrial).\n",
    "1. thalach - Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise. This is determined by calculating 220 - age = estimated maximum heart rate.\n",
    "1. exang - Exercise Induced Angina (1 - yes, 0 = no)\n",
    "1. oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.\n",

    "When interpreting an ECG strip, each small square is 1mm in length and represents 0.04 seconds. Each larger square is 5mm in length and represents 0.20 seconds. These measurements are used in interpreting an ECG strip obtained from the ECG test. Each wave has parameters in seconds that determine if the rhythm strip segments meet normal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model will determine whether the sample size has heart disease based on the above attributes in our data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the data set looks at the QRS complex, ST segment depression and identifies three indications determining the risk of heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. slope - The slope of the peak exercise ST segment:\n",
    "    1. Value 1: Upsloping ST-segment depression is normal finding during physical exercise, unless the T-waves are inverted or at rest being a sign of heart disease and evidence of an acute myocardial infarction (stroke).\n",
    "    1. Value 2: Flat ST-segment is isoelectric and normal.\n",
    "    1. Value 3: Downsloping ST-segment is typical of ischemia. Deviations in ST-segment always indicates ongoing ischemia and may be accompanied by T-wave changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The illustration below also shows a horizontal ST-segment depression which also depicts ischemia. However, this type of ST-segment depression is not included in our data set.\n",
