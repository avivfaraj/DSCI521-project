## Abstract: 
This research presents a data analytics approach and breakdown of the dataset containing heart disease patient symptoms. 
Our analysis explores heart disease among a population of males and females between 29 and 77 years of age using risk factors that determine its prevalence.
We used popular python libraries to demonstrate our data interpretation and exploration.
We were able to plot various forms of the dataset to show which symptoms were most important to the audience.
We were able to leverage tensorflow and other python machine learning packages to overall precision of the dataset.
